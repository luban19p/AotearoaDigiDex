### University of Waikato, Hamilton
##### Bryony Hawthorn
Kia ora! I work in the Information Services team at the University of Waikato and have done for almost four years. Before that I worked in a public library for 10 years and had a career in journalism before that.

My team mainly works with undergraduates but we are involved with some postgraduate students. Our role involves:
* Teaching information literacy, searching skills and APA referencing
* Staffing the library reference desk
* Staffing the library instant messaging/chat service
* Answering emails from staff and students
* Marketing and promoting the library, including using social media and making library video guides
We try to experiment with new technology but time doesn't always allow us to explore and experiment as much as we want. So I'm looking forward to learning what others are using, what's worked or hasn't worked and how we can upskill our staff. 

### Massey University, Palmerston North
##### Heather Lamond
I'm Heather Lamond, Associate University Librarian Client Services at Massey University. I'm physically based at the Manawatu Campus in Palmerston North, but responsible for teaching, learning and research support across all 3 Massey campuses in Wellington, Auckland and Palmy, as well as Distance. I'm also responsible overall for staff development and capability. 
I am a bit of a gadget/digital nerd and volunteered to be Massey's Digital Dexterity Champion for that reason. 

### Victoria University of Wellington
##### Marisa King
I’m a Team Leader Subject Librarians at Victoria University, with a long-standing interest in digital literacy and online learning. I’ve worked in public, special and academic libraries for the past 13 years. I’m currently training for a marathon and doing a creative writing course. 

### University of Canterbury, Christchurch
##### Lyndsay Ainsworth 
Kia ora koutou. He Pou Tuarua o Ngā Puna Mātaraka o Te Whare Wānaka o Waitaha te mahi. Ko Lyndsay Ainsworth tōku ingoa. I’m Lyndsay Ainsworth from University of Canterbury Library where I am the Associate University Librarian for Learning and Teaching. 
I’ve been interested in things digital right from the time 30 years when as a Library Assistant I was encouraged to play around with gadgets, to learn to use NZBN (an early online system), etc. I volunteered to be the Digidex champion here at UC, but it certainly won’t just be me, and my colleague Sara Roberts and the subject librarian and e-services teams will be very much part of what happens going forward. We are excited to be part of a group and community of practice in this area. My kiwi icons as shared are a (well-re(a)d) plastic penguin that I helped to make on our 3D printer, chosen because Christchurch is the Gateway to the Antarctic and we have research teams working from UC, and also a pack of Te Reo (Maori language) playing cards signifying that University of Canterbury/ Te Whare Wānaka o Waitaha is on a bicultural journey that includes building our skills in the Reo using high and low tech methods.
